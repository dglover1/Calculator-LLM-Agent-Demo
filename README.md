# Calculator-LLM-Agent-Demo

Simple demo using the Transformers Agents API, specifically ReactJsonAgent.

Llama-3.2-3B-Instruct acts as a calculator agent with access to a suite of tools for performing mathematical operations.

The agent can solve multi-stage calculations by chaining together tool calls, rather than attempting to use its internal mathematical knowledge which can be unreliable.
